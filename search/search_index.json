It has assisted us in the little areas such as planning for a vacation, to playing an integral role in critical infrastructure such as financial networks and healthcare systems. Personally, I have friends who have experienced chatting with an AI assistant for emotional support or advice. It almost certainly seems as if it\u2019s becoming... human.</p> <p>This sparks a question: if an AI truly understands \u201cTruth\u201d or only simulates it to great accuracy in its responses and words. Or is truth meant to be calculated and derived from numbers and figures? This essay aims to share the philosophical perspective on Truth and how AI would approach it when it comes to fulfilling its taskings.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/11/09/artificial-intelligence-does-it-understand-truth-or-emulates-it/#what-is-truth","title":"What is Truth?","text":"<p>Truth can be framed and perceived through two major theories in philosophy, the correspondence theory and coherence theory.</p> <p>In correspondence theory, we can deem a statement or fact as true when it reflects our observations. For example, we know that the sky is blue because we observe it day to day. The correspondence theory was expressed by both Aristotle and Plato and continued to be formalised by Bertrand Russell and G.E. Moore in the 20th century. This simple theory became a core foundation for other theories of truth. Many theories that followed employed similar concepts of finding relations of a truth statement to reality, through concepts such as conformity, congruence and signification.</p> <p>As for the coherence theory of Truth, it states that a statement of belief is true if it is also consistent with a larger set of beliefs. In the past, the coherence theory was commonly associated with idealism. It emerged mainly from German Idealist philosophy during the 18th and 19th centuries among philosophers like Baruch Spinoza, G.W.F. Hegel, and F.H. Bradley. Coherence can be seen from both the metaphysical and epistemological perspectives. From the metaphysical view, the truth of a belief is seen as its ability to integrate into reality\u2019s large system of interconnected ideas and beliefs. Meanwhile, the epistemological view measures how truthful a belief or statement is based on our ability to justify it. In short, the metaphysical route focuses on defining what reality is in relation to truth and belief, whereas the epistemological route focuses on how we justify and comprehend truth.</p> <p>I personally believe too that Truth is derived from a system of beliefs. For years, we compare our views with known facts discovered by others to make judgments or understand concepts new to us. For example, we grew up learning that World War II ended in 1945, which is a fact believed by educators, historians and historians in our day and age. And the facts they believe in originated from writers and significant figures from the past.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/11/09/artificial-intelligence-does-it-understand-truth-or-emulates-it/#does-artificial-intelligence-understand-truth","title":"Does Artificial Intelligence understand Truth?","text":"<p>On a higher level of understanding, it appears that AI can believe in certain Truths and make fair judgments and reasonings when trying to help its user. The rise in popularity of reasoning models seems to prove its capability. Reasoning models are trained to break a problem into smaller steps or \u201creason traces\u201d, by employing chain-of-thought reasoning on complex tasks like solving a large math question or producing code with robust logic.</p> <p>AI also employs techniques to understand natural language, such as vectorisation, which converts the meaning of tokens, made of chunks of text or individual words, into numbers that a computer can make correlations and comparisons to in terms of their meaning.</p> <p>However, looking back at how Truth is defined, from a philosophical perspective, Truth is built on experiences and beliefs. In correspondence, we experience something to know it is true, and in coherence, we know something is true from its ability to fit into a web of beliefs. Fundamentally, beliefs shape what we know is truly true.</p> <p>As such, believing something is not the same as simply knowing it. From a book \u201cIntuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking\u201d by Daniel C. Dennett, Daniel illustrates the core building blocks of beliefs:</p> <ol> <li>An analogy is shared about a child who is asked what her father does for a living. The child     would just reply that he is a doctor.</li> <li>The analogy goes on to illustrate that there is no certainty that she believes what she has said at     that young age. In other words, just because she has said it, it does not mean she believes it.</li> <li>However, it is through her experiences growing up that she understands what a doctor does and     relates that to her knowledge of her father.</li> <li>With this collection of knowledge and experiences, she will form her belief that her father is     indeed a doctor.</li> </ol> <p>In short, Daniel sees belief as something built on understanding, which is formed by real-world experiences. Truth is something built on beliefs, which cannot be derived from calculations alone.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/11/09/artificial-intelligence-does-it-understand-truth-or-emulates-it/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>I believe that AI does not understand Truth; rather, it has an ability to emulate it, to provide cutting- edge reasoning capabilities for us to form our own judgments on what is true or not. However, this does not minimise the value and purpose of AI in our lives. I strongly believe that as AI continues to advance and draw closer to mimicking human intelligence, it remains our role to define our own beliefs and Truths. While AI can support us with logic and reasoning, only we can offer the depth of human experiences and emotions.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/11/09/artificial-intelligence-does-it-understand-truth-or-emulates-it/#references","title":"References","text":"<p>(2013).

Normally, slots would have been taken up by other students by the time I login to see the slots.</p> <p>The solution:</p> <p>Automate a script that authenticates me into the portal and query for the latest booking slots before updating me via Discord.</p> <p>Breaking down the problem, I came to conclusion on the resources I needed:</p> <p>All scripts will be written in Python for flexibility and convenience. As for the modules used, I ended up using the following,</p> <ul> <li> <p>Python Requests</p> <ul> <li>Perform both POST and GET requests programmatically to our target website and store cookies and user data into session objects</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>BeautifulSoup</p> <ul> <li>Scraping of HTML body from HTTP requests to extract important information such as the request verification token from the HTML body</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Selenium </p> <ul> <li>Automatically flashing our webpage and retrieving a recaptcha token for authentication (it was impossible to retrieve the token from the HTML body via web-scraping or launching the browser in headless mode)</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Chromedriver.py </p> <ul> <li>Ensure that the Chrome drivers used for Selenium was up-to-date</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Configparser </p> <ul> <li>Conveniently set necessary config information, such as that needed to authenticate ourselves into the target website</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Discord.py </p> <ul> <li>A Discord API will be used so that the information retrieved from the website can be sent conveniently to my phone via a channel message</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>I ended up hosting my script on a Linux Debian server via DigitalOcean. After creating a server instance, I configured a GUI and accessed it via a remote desktop.

Using the BeautifulSoup library in python, I was able to retrieve the token value to be used in the request payload in order to establish a user session for the program. </p> <p>The second information needed was a google Captcha key. This however was very difficult to achieve through the same means as the web-scraping technique used previously. </p> <p>Google Captcha key is issued via an external script on the webpage. Thus, using the python get request, it is not possible to retrieve the key value in the DOM body as the script has not been executed. Even rendering the page will not allow the script to retrieve the key since the render function might not support the execution of external scripts or API scripts. Using selenium, the browser driver will be able to load the HTML content after the javascripts have been fully executed, utilizing the capabilities of automated testing.</p> <p>However, using headless testing (meaning that the chrome driver of selenium runs in the background), Google Captcha keys appear to be invalid. It may be due to the lack of a \"normal\" browser for Google to assign cookies or verify the client.</p> <p>Thus the final solution is to utilize automated testing from selenium to retrieve the HTML elements after script execution, before passing the retrieved key over to the bot for form validation. The compromise is that the chrome driver window will appear for a second before minimizing and closing after the key has been retrieved.</p>"},{"location":"projects/web-scraping-api-project/#querying-of-data","title":"Querying of data","text":"<p>After solving the login segment, I had to figure out how the webpage was queried in order to retrieve information on the latest lesson slots.
